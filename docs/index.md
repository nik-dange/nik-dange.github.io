# Welcome to my page!!

My name is Nikhil, and I'm a junior studying **Computer Engineering** @ UC San Diego. Feel free to navigate to any parts of my page to learn more about me!

## **Interests**

Here are some of my current interests, both technical and non-technical!

### **Technical**
1. Software Engineering
2. Back-end Development
3. Containers and orchestration software
    - Currently learning more about software like Docker and Kubernetes!

One language I worked with this past summer was TypeScript - here's how to say Hello World in TypeScript:

```
let message: string = 'Hello World!';
console.log(message);
```

### **Non-technical**

1. Football
    - Specifically the NFL
2. Swimming
3. Cooking (or learning how to)
4. Formula 1
    - I just got into this pretty recently but it's a super unique sport to learn about

I'm also pretty into exploring beaches in San Diego! Here are a few pictures of my favorite beaches:
